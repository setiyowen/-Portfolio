### About me ðŸ‘‹
Hi, my name is Owen. Since the beginning of 2023, I have been studying and training to become a Quality Assurance (QA) professional. I am thrilled to have finally found a field where I can grow and develop myself effectively. I believe there is great potential to make the digital world more inclusive and accessible to everyone. Through this portfolio, I aim to share my knowledge about QA and showcase the practical skills I have acquired through courses, self-study, and work experience. I am determined to continue growing in this field. Currently, I am also learning test automation, so my main focus is on deepening my understanding and gaining more hands-on experience in this area.
